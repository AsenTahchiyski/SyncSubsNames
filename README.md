# SyncSubsNames

Love watching series?\
Tired of renaming subtitle files, so your favourite video player loads them automatically when you open a video?\
\
This is a simple C# Windows Forms app to automatically match and rename the respective episode subtitle file to the respective video file title.\
\
Usage: Clone repo, build project, run the executable in \bin\Release\app.publish.\
\
In case you don't know how to build the project or just don't have time for that: https://www.dropbox.com/s/yigrac4xwsovonf/SyncSubsNames.zip?dl=0
